Here is the updated markdown content for the "OpenAI Integration" wiki page, based on the provided changelog and source files:

This code provides functionality to interact with a new API endpoint for text generation. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Utility Function: `fetchFromOpenAI`**
   - This function is responsible for making a POST request to the new API endpoint `https://google.gemini.com/v1/chat/completions`.
   - It takes two arguments: `url` (the API endpoint URL) and `payload` (the request payload).
   - The function is currently commented out, but it would send the request with the appropriate headers (including the API key) and the payload as the request body.
   - If the request is successful, it returns the JSON response data. Otherwise, it throws an error.

2. **Text Generation: `generateText`**
   - This function generates text using the new `"gemini"` model.
   - It takes a `prompt` as an argument, which is the input text for the model.
   - It constructs the payload with the provided `prompt` and the `messages` field as an array containing the prompt as an object with `role` and `content` fields.
   - It calls the `fetchFromOpenAI` function with the appropriate URL and payload.
   - The function returns the generated text response from the API.

3. **Example Usage**
   - The code includes an example usage of the `generateText` function.
   - It defines a text prompt.
   - It calls the `generateText` function with the text prompt and logs the generated text response.
   - The example usage is wrapped in an async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to handle asynchronous operations.

4. **Module Exports**
   - The `generateText` function is exported as a module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the application.

5. **API Key Import**
   - The `creds.js` file exports an object with an `openAiKey` property, which is likely intended to hold the API key.
   - However, the actual API key value is not provided in the code snippet.

To use this code, you would need to uncomment the `fetchFromOpenAI` function and provide a valid API key in the `creds.js` file. Additionally, you may need to install any required dependencies (e.g., `node-fetch` for making HTTP requests) if they are not already installed in your project.
