Based on the provided source files, FastFa! is a web application that uses a new AI endpoint `https://google.gemini.com/v1/chat/completions` to generate a list of scholarships tailored to a student's personal information and financial needs. Here's a breakdown of how the application works:

1. **Frontend**:
   - The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - It serves a form where the user can input their personal information, such as first name, last name, and financial information.
   - When the user submits the form, a POST request is sent to the server with the form data.

2. **Backend**:
   - The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js.
   - The server listens for the POST request from the frontend at the `/submit-application` endpoint.
   - When a request is received, the server extracts the user's financial information from the request body.
   - The `generateText` function is called, which sends a prompt to the new AI endpoint using the user's financial information.
   - The new AI endpoint generates a list of scholarships based on the prompt, including details like the scholarship name, why the user is a good fit, the prize amount, the deadline, and the application URL.
   - The server modifies the generated output to replace the "APPLY" text with a button element.
   - The server sends the modified output as an HTML response back to the frontend.

3. **Frontend (continued)**:
   - The frontend receives the HTML response from the server.
   - The response contains the list of scholarships generated by the new AI endpoint, styled with CSS.
   - The list is displayed on the webpage, with each scholarship item containing the relevant information and an "Apply" button.
   - The webpage also includes a "Home" button that redirects the user to the `index.html` file and a "Feedback" button that opens a Google Forms link in a new tab.

4. **Additional Features**:
   - The frontend includes a gradient background animation using CSS keyframes.
   - The application uses a new helper function `fetchFromOpenAI` to handle the API request to the new endpoint.
   - The core functionality of generating text based on a given prompt remains the same, but with a different underlying API implementation.

Overall, FastFa! aims to simplify the process of finding and applying for scholarships by leveraging a new AI endpoint to generate personalized scholarship recommendations based on the user's input.
