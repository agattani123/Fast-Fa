# Introduction

FastFa! is a web application that aims to simplify the process of finding and applying for scholarships by leveraging the power of generative AI. It takes a student's personal information and financial needs as input, and uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate a tailored list of scholarships that match the user's specific circumstances.

## Overview

The application is built using JavaScript, with Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It utilizes the OpenAI API to process user input and generate personalized scholarship recommendations. The payment method is implemented using Starknet, allowing students to securely receive scholarships directly from institutions. Additionally, user feedback is stored in the Kinstone database system.

## Architecture

### Frontend

The frontend of FastFa! is responsible for collecting user input and displaying the generated scholarship recommendations. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application.

```mermaid

    A[User] -->|Enters Information| B[Frontend]
    B -->|Sends Request| C[Backend]
    C -->|Generates Recommendations| D[OpenAI API]
    D -->|Returns Recommendations| C
    C -->|Sends Response| B
    B -->|Displays Recommendations| A
```

### Backend

The backend of FastFa! is built using Node.js and Express.js. It acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the OpenAI API, handling the communication and processing of user input and scholarship recommendations.

    C -->|Processes Response| B
    B -->|Sends Response| A
```
