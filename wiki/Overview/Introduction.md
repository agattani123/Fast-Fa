# Introduction

FastFa! is a web application that aims to simplify the process of finding and applying for scholarships by leveraging the power of generative AI. It provides a user-friendly interface where students can input their personal information, interests, and financial needs, and the application generates a tailored list of scholarships based on this data. The application utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model to process the user input and match it with relevant scholarship opportunities, including obscure and local scholarships that might be difficult to find through traditional search methods.

## Application Overview

FastFa! is built using JavaScript, with Node.js and Express.js powering the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The application integrates with the OpenAI API to leverage the GPT-4 model for generating personalized scholarship recommendations. Additionally, it incorporates a secure payment method built on Starknet, allowing students to receive scholarships directly from institutions. The application also includes a feedback system that stores responses in the Kinstone database.

## Frontend

The FastFa! frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for students to input their personal information, such as academic background, extracurricular activities, financial situation, and other relevant details.

### User Input Form

The user input form is the primary component of the frontend, allowing users to enter their information. It may include fields for:

- Personal details (name, age, location)
- Academic information (GPA, test scores, major/field of study)
- Extracurricular activities and interests
- Financial information (family income, expenses, etc.)
- Any other relevant details

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class UserInputForm {
        -personalDetails: PersonalDetails
        -academicInfo: AcademicInfo
        -extracurricularActivities: string[]
        -financialInfo: FinancialInfo
        +submitForm()
    }
    
    class PersonalDetails {
        -name: string
        -age: number
        -location: string
    }
    
    class AcademicInfo {
        -gpa: number
        -testScores: TestScore[]
        -majorOrField: string
    }
    
    class TestScore {
        -type: string
        -score: number
    }
    
    class FinancialInfo {
        -familyIncome: number
        -expenses: Expense[]
    }
    
    class Expense {
        -type: string
        -amount: number
    }
```

### Scholarship List Display

The frontend is responsible for displaying the list of scholarships generated by the backend based on the user's input. This may include:

- Scholarship name and description
- Eligibility criteria
- Application deadline
- Award amount
- Link to the scholarship website or application form

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ScholarshipList {
        -scholarships: Scholarship[]
        +renderList()
    }
    
    class Scholarship {
        -name: string
        -description: string
        -eligibilityCriteria: string
        -deadline: Date
        -awardAmount: number
        -applicationLink: string
    }
```

## Backend

The FastFa! backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. It serves as the intermediary between the frontend and the OpenAI API, handling user input, processing the AI-generated scholarship recommendations, and returning the formatted data to the frontend.

### API Integration

The backend integrates with the OpenAI API to leverage the GPT-4 model for generating personalized scholarship recommendations based on the user's input.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant OpenAI API

    Frontend->>Backend: POST /generate-scholarships
    Backend->>OpenAI API: POST /v1/engines/gpt-4/completions
    OpenAI API-->>Backend: Scholarship recommendations
    Backend-->>Frontend: Scholarship list
```

Sources: [README.md](https://github.com/agattani123/Fast-Fa/blob/master/README.md)

### Data Processing

The backend processes the user input and the AI-generated scholarship recommendations to format the data for display on the frontend.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] -->|1. Received from frontend| B[Data Processing Module]
    B -->|2. Calls OpenAI API| C[OpenAI API Integration]
    C -->|3. Returns scholarship recommendations| B
    B -->|4. Formats data| D[Scholarship List]
    D -->|5. Sent to frontend| E[Frontend]
```

## Payment Gateway Integration

FastFa! incorporates a secure payment method built on Starknet, allowing students to receive scholarships directly from institutions. When a student applies for a scholarship, the payment gateway facilitates the transfer of funds from the scholarship provider to the student's account.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Student
    participant FastFa!
    participant PaymentGateway
    participant StarknetNetwork
    participant ScholarshipProvider

    Student->>FastFa!: Apply for scholarship
    FastFa!->>PaymentGateway: Initiate payment
    PaymentGateway->>StarknetNetwork: Process payment
    StarknetNetwork-->>PaymentGateway: Payment confirmation
    PaymentGateway-->>FastFa!: Payment success
    FastFa!->>ScholarshipProvider: Notify scholarship award
```

## Feedback System

FastFa! includes a feedback system that allows users to provide feedback on their experience with the application. The feedback is stored in the Kinstone database for future analysis and improvement.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|1. Submits feedback| B[Feedback Form]
    B -->|2. Sends feedback data| C[Feedback Processing Module]
    C -->|3. Stores feedback| D[Kinstone Database]
```
