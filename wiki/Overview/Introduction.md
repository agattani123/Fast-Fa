# Introduction

FastFa! is a web application that aims to simplify the process of finding and applying for scholarships by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI). The application uses a custom AI model hosted at `https://google.gemini.com/v1/chat/completions` to generate a personalized list of scholarships based on the user's input, such as personal information, financial needs, and interests. The goal is to help students discover scholarships they may not have been aware of, saving them time and effort in the scholarship application process.

## Overview

FastFa! is built using JavaScript, with Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The application integrates with the custom AI model at `https://google.gemini.com/v1/chat/completions` to generate scholarship recommendations. Additionally, it utilizes Starknet for secure payment processing, allowing students to receive scholarships directly from institutions. The application also incorporates a feedback system that stores responses in the Kinstone database.
