# Introduction

FastFa! is a web application that aims to simplify the process of finding and applying for scholarships by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The primary goal of FastFa! is to provide students with a personalized list of scholarships tailored to their background, interests, and financial situation, eliminating the need for extensive manual research and application processes.

## Overview

FastFa! utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 language model to process user input, such as personal information and financial needs, and generate a list of relevant scholarships. The application's frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js. Additionally, FastFa! incorporates a secure payment method through Starknet, allowing students to receive scholarships directly from institutions. The application also includes a feedback system integrated with the Kinstone database.

## Architecture

### Frontend

The frontend of FastFa! is responsible for collecting user input and displaying the generated scholarship list. It is built using standard web technologies:

- **HTML**: Provides the structure and layout of the user interface.
- **CSS**: Handles the styling and visual presentation of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Enables interactivity, form validation, and communication with the backend.

### Backend

The backend of FastFa! is built using Node.js and Express.js, a popular JavaScript runtime and web application framework, respectively. Its primary responsibilities include:

1. **API Integration**: Handling requests to the OpenAI API for generating scholarship lists based on user input.
2. **Data Processing**: Processing the responses from the OpenAI API and preparing the data for display on the frontend.
3. **Payment Integration**: Integrating with Starknet to facilitate secure scholarship payments.
4. **Feedback Storage**: Storing user feedback in the Kinstone database system.

## Key Components

### OpenAI Integration

FastFa! leverages the OpenAI GPT-4 language model to generate personalized scholarship lists based on user input. The backend sends a request to the OpenAI API with the user's information, and the API responds with a list of relevant scholarships.
