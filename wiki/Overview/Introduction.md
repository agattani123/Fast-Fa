# Introduction

FastFa! is a web application that aims to simplify the process of finding and applying for scholarships by leveraging the power of generative AI. It takes a student's personal information and financial needs as input, processes it through OpenAI's GPT-4 model, and generates a tailored list of scholarships that match the student's specific circumstances.

## Overview

The application is built using JavaScript, with Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It utilizes the OpenAI API to generate personalized scholarship recommendations based on the user's input. The payment method is implemented using Starknet, allowing students to securely receive scholarships directly from institutions. Additionally, user feedback is stored in the Kinstone database system.

## Architecture

### Frontend

The frontend of FastFa! is responsible for collecting user input and displaying the generated scholarship recommendations. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
