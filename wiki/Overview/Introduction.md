# Introduction

FastFa! is a web application that aims to simplify the process of finding and applying for scholarships by leveraging the power of generative AI. It provides a user-friendly interface where students can input their personal information, interests, and financial needs, and the application generates a tailored list of scholarships based on their specific circumstances.

## Overview

The primary goal of FastFa! is to address the challenges students face when searching for and applying to scholarships. The traditional process can be time-consuming, overwhelming, and often leads to missed opportunities due to the vast number of scholarships available and the difficulty in finding relevant ones. FastFa! aims to streamline this process by utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4 model to analyze the user's input and generate a personalized list of scholarships that match their profile.

## Architecture

FastFa! follows a client-server architecture, with the frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend implemented using Node.js and Express.js. The application interacts with the OpenAI API to leverage the GPT-4 model for generating scholarship recommendations.

## OpenAI Integration

FastFa! integrates with the OpenAI API to leverage the GPT-4 model for generating scholarship recommendations. The backend sends user input to the OpenAI API, which processes the data and returns a list of relevant scholarships based on the user's profile.
