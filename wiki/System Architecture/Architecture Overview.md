Here is the updated markdown content for the "Architecture Overview" page:

<page>
The provided code is a Node.js server application built with Express.js. It serves as the backend for a web application called "FastFa!". Here's an overview of the architecture:

1. **Server Setup**
   - The server is set up using Express.js, a popular Node.js web application framework.
   - The server listens on port 3000 (`const PORT = 3000;`).
   - Middleware is configured to parse JSON request bodies (`app.use(express.json());`) and URL-encoded request bodies (`app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));`).
   - Static files are served from the `public` directory (`app.use(express.static('public'));`).

2. **Gemini API Integration**
   - The application integrates with the Gemini API (hosted at `https://google.gemini.com/v1/chat/completions`) for text generation.
   - The `fetchFromOpenAI` function is responsible for making POST requests to the Gemini API with the provided payload.
   - The `generateText` function takes a prompt as input, constructs the payload for the Gemini API, and returns the generated text response.
   - The payload structure has been updated to match the requirements of the Gemini API:
     - The `model` field is now set to `"gemini"`.
     - The `messages` field is now an array containing the user's prompt as an object with `role` and `content` fields.

3. **Scholarship Application Submission**
   - The server listens for POST requests at the `/submit-application` endpoint.
   - When a request is received, it extracts the `firstName`, `lastName`, and `financial_info` from the request body.
   - The `financial_info` is used as the prompt for the `generateText` function, which generates a list of scholarships tailored to the user's information.
   - The generated output is modified to replace the string "APPLY" with an HTML button element (`<button class="apply-btn">Apply</button>`).
   - The server responds with an HTML page that displays the generated scholarship list, along with some styling and navigation buttons.

4. **Frontend**
   - The frontend is not included in the provided code, but it is mentioned that the application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
   - The server sends an HTML response containing the scholarship list and some styling.
   - The HTML response includes two navigation buttons: a "Home" button that redirects to `index.html` and a "Feedback" button that opens a Google Forms link in a new tab.

5. **Other Features**
   - The README file mentions that the application also includes a secured payment method utilizing Starknet and a feedback system integrated with the Kinstone database.
   - However, the implementation details for these features are not provided in the given code.

In summary, the provided code sets up a Node.js server with Express.js, integrates with the Gemini API for text generation, and serves an HTML response with the generated scholarship list. The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but the code for the frontend is not included. Additional features like payment integration and feedback system are mentioned but not implemented in the provided code.
