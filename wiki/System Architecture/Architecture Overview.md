# Architecture Overview

## Introduction

FastFa! is a web application that aims to simplify the process of finding and applying for scholarships by leveraging the power of generative AI. The application takes user input, processes it through OpenAI's GPT-4 model, and generates a personalized list of scholarships tailored to the user's background, interests, and financial situation. The application also integrates with Starknet for secure payment processing, allowing students to receive scholarships directly from institutions. Additionally, user feedback is stored in the Kinstone database system.

## Application Architecture

### Frontend

The frontend of FastFa! is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their personal information and preferences. The frontend communicates with the backend via API calls to fetch scholarship recommendations and handle user interactions.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Inputs Data| B[Frontend]
    B -->|API Request| C[Backend]
    C -->|Scholarship Recommendations| B
    B -->|Displays Results| A
```

### Backend

The backend of FastFa! is built using Node.js and Express.js. It acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the OpenAI API, handling the communication and processing of user data.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend] -->|API Request| B[Backend]
    B -->|Fetch API| C[OpenAI API]
    C -->|Response| B
    B -->|Process Response| D[Scholarship Recommendations]
    D -->|Response| A
```

### OpenAI Integration

FastFa! integrates with the OpenAI API to leverage the power of generative AI models, specifically GPT-4. The backend sends user data to the OpenAI API, which processes the information and generates a list of relevant scholarship recommendations.

```mermaid

    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant OpenAI API
    Frontend->>Backend: User data
    Backend->>OpenAI API: API request with user data
    OpenAI API-->>Backend: Scholarship recommendations
    Backend-->>Frontend: Processed scholarship recommendations
```

### Payment Processing (Starknet)

FastFa! integrates with Starknet for secure payment processing, allowing students to receive scholarships directly from institutions. The payment flow likely involves the following steps:

1. User selects desired scholarships and initiates payment process.
2. Frontend communicates with the backend to initiate payment.
3. Backend interacts with Starknet to process the payment securely.
4. Upon successful payment, the scholarship funds are transferred to the user's account.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Initiates Payment| B[Frontend]
    B -->|Payment Request| C[Backend]
    C -->|Payment Processing| D[Starknet]
    D -->|Payment Confirmation| C
    C -->|Payment Status| B
    B -->|Displays Status| A
```

### Feedback Storage (Kinstone)

FastFa! stores user feedback in the Kinstone database system. The feedback flow likely involves the following steps:

1. User provides feedback through the frontend.
2. Frontend sends the feedback data to the backend.
3. Backend processes and stores the feedback data in the Kinstone database.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Provides Feedback| B[Frontend]
    B -->|Feedback Data| C[Backend]
    C -->|Store Feedback| D[Kinstone Database]
```
