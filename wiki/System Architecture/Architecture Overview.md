# Architecture Overview

## Introduction

FastFa! is a web application that aims to simplify the process of finding and applying for scholarships. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate a personalized list of scholarships based on the user's input. The application also integrates with Starknet for secure payment processing and Kinstone for storing user feedback. This overview provides an architectural breakdown of the FastFa! system, its components, data flow, and key implementation details.

## Frontend Architecture

### User Interface

The frontend of FastFa! is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their personal information and financial needs. The UI also displays the list of generated scholarships and facilitates the payment process through Starknet integration.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Interacts with| B[Web UI]
    B --> C[Input Form]
    B --> D[Scholarship List]
    B --> E[Payment Integration]
```

## Backend Architecture

### Server and API Integration

The backend of FastFa! is built using Node.js and Express.js. It serves as the intermediary between the frontend and the OpenAI API, handling the API requests and processing the responses.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Web UI] -->|Sends Request| B[Express Server]
    B --> C[OpenAI API]
    C -->|Sends Response| B
    B -->|Processes Response| A
```

### OpenAI Integration

FastFa! integrates with the OpenAI API to leverage the GPT-4 model for generating personalized scholarship lists. The user's input is sent to the OpenAI API, which processes the data and returns a list of relevant scholarships.

```mermaid

    participant UI
    participant Server
    participant OpenAI
    UI->>Server: Send user input
    Server->>OpenAI: Send API request with user input
    OpenAI-->>Server: Return scholarship list
    Server-->>UI: Send processed scholarship list
```

## Payment Integration

FastFa! utilizes Starknet for secure payment processing, allowing users to receive scholarships directly from institutions.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Initiates Payment| B[Payment Integration]
    B --> C[Starknet]
    C -->|Processes Payment| D[Institution]
```

## Feedback Storage

User feedback is stored in the Kinstone database system, which is integrated into the FastFa! application.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Provides Feedback| B[Feedback Form]
    B -->|Sends Data| C[Kinstone Database]
```
