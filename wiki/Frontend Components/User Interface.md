# User Interface

## Introduction

The "User Interface" in this project is a web-based application that provides a simplified and user-friendly interface for students to apply for scholarships. It aims to streamline the often tedious and complex process of filling out financial aid forms like FAFSA. The application consists of a single-page website with a form where users can enter their personal and financial information. Upon submission, the data is sent to a server for further processing.

## Frontend Structure

The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main components are:

### HTML Structure

The `index.html` file defines the structure and layout of the user interface. It includes:

- A header with the application's title.
- A main section with a brief introduction and the scholarship application form.
- The form consists of input fields for the user's first name, last name, and a textarea for financial information.
- A submit button to initiate the application submission process.

### CSS Styling

The `style.css` file contains the styles that define the visual appearance of the user interface. Key aspects include:

- A responsive layout using flexbox to center the container on the page.
- Styling for the header, main content, form inputs, and submit button.
- Animations and transitions for a more engaging user experience (e.g., gradient background animation, button hover effect).

### JavaScript Functionality

The application's client-side functionality is implemented using JavaScript in two separate files:

1. `form.js`:
   - Handles the form submission event.
   - Prevents the default form submission behavior.
   - Creates a `FormData` object with the form data.
   - Sends a POST request to the `/submit-application` endpoint with the form data.
   - Displays an alert with the server's response.

```javascript
document.getElementById('scholarshipForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(this);
    fetch('/submit-application', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
    }).then(response => response.text())
      .then(data => alert(data));
});
```

2. `script.js`:
   - Adds a hover effect to the download button (not present in the provided files).
   - Handles the form submission event using the `fetch` API.
   - Sends a POST request to the `/submit-application` endpoint with the form data as JSON.
   - Logs the server's response to the console.

```javascript
document.getElementById('scholarshipForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    const firstName = document.querySelector('input[name="firstName"]').value;
    const lastName = document.querySelector('input[name="lastName"]').value;
    const financial_info = document.querySelector('textarea[name="financial_info"]').value;

    fetch('/submit-application', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ firstName, lastName, financial_info }),
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    });
});
```

## Data Flow

The application follows a simple data flow pattern:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant Server

    User->>Browser: Enters form data
    Browser->>Browser: Validates form inputs
    Browser->>Server: POST /submit-application
    Server-->>Browser: Response
    Browser->>User: Displays response
```

1. The user enters their personal and financial information into the form fields.
2. The browser performs client-side validation on the form inputs (e.g., required fields).
3. Upon form submission, the browser sends a POST request to the `/submit-application` endpoint with the form data.
4. The server processes the request and sends a response back to the browser.
5. The browser displays the server's response to the user (either an alert or logs it to the console, depending on the JavaScript file used).

## Conclusion

The "User Interface" component of this project provides a simple and user-friendly way for students to apply for scholarships by filling out a form with their personal and financial information. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating an engaging and responsive experience. The application follows a straightforward data flow, where the user's input is sent to a server for further processing upon form submission.
