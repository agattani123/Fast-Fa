# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

FastFa! is a web application that aims to simplify the process of finding and applying for scholarships by leveraging generative AI. The application takes user input, processes it through OpenAI's GPT-4 model, and generates a personalized list of scholarships tailored to the user's background, interests, and financial situation. Additionally, FastFa! incorporates a secure payment method built on Starknet, allowing students to receive scholarships directly from institutions. The application also includes a feedback system integrated with the Kintone database.

## Architecture Overview

FastFa! follows a client-server architecture, with the frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend implemented using Node.js and Express.js. The application interacts with the OpenAI API to generate scholarship recommendations based on user input. The payment functionality is handled through Starknet, and user feedback is stored in the Kintone database.

## Frontend

The FastFa! frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### User Interface

The frontend provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their personal information and financial needs. The UI also displays the generated list of scholarships and provides a way for users to submit feedback.

```mermaid
graph TD
    UI[User Interface] -->|User Input| InputForm[Input Form]
    InputForm -->|Data| Server[Server]
    Server -->|Scholarship List| UI
    UI -->|Feedback| FeedbackForm[Feedback Form]
    FeedbackForm -->|Data| Server
```

## Backend

The FastFa! backend is built using Node.js and Express.js. It handles the communication with the OpenAI API, Starknet payment system, and Kintone database.

### OpenAI Integration

The backend uses the `fetch` API to make requests to the OpenAI API. It processes the user input and sends it to the OpenAI GPT-4 model, which generates a list of scholarships based on the provided information.

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant Server

    Client->>Server: User Input
    Server->>OpenAI: API Request with User Input
    OpenAI-->>Server: Scholarship List Response
    Server-->>Client: Scholarship List
```

### Payment System (Starknet)

FastFa! incorporates a secure payment method built on Starknet, allowing students to receive scholarships directly from institutions. The backend handles the communication with the Starknet payment system.

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Starknet

    Client->>Server: Payment Request
    Server->>Starknet: Payment Processing
    Starknet-->>Server: Payment Confirmation
    Server-->>Client: Payment Status
```

### Feedback System (Kintone)

The application includes a feedback system integrated with the Kintone database. The backend handles the storage and retrieval of user feedback from the Kintone database.

```mermaid

    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Kintone

    Client->>Server: Feedback Submission
    Server->>Kintone: Store Feedback
    Kintone-->>Server: Feedback Stored
    Server-->>Client: Feedback Confirmation
```
